About  
_____________________________________________

Automatic Identification of Chess Moves in a live game. Presently, this task is
done manually and requires an extra person, but we can easily automate this task
by processing the video (live or otherwise) of a game.  

We can also display the game online through a graphical representation.
Graphical Representations have the advantage of being light weight compared to
good quality videos.
